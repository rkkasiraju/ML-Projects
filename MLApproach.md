How to approach it?
Load and explore data (check missing values, distributions)

Clean and preprocess (fill missing ages, encode categorical variables)

Feature engineering (e.g., combine SibSp and Parch, extract title from Name)

Split data into train and test sets

Train classification models

Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve

Tune hyperparameters to improve model

Make final predictions
